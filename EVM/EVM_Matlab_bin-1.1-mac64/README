This package is a binary version of our MATLAB implementation of the paper:

Eulerian Video Magnification for Revealing Subtle Changes in the World
ACM Transaction on Graphics, Volume 31, Number 4 (Proceedings SIGGRAPH
2012)

This version of our algorithm can be run from the command line. It doesn't
require any programming or for MATLAB to be installed. Instead, all that is
needed is the MATLAB Compiler Runtime, which is free and only takes a couple
of minutes to install.

See below for installation instructions, running instructions and 
licensing information.

this software, please contact:

------------------------------------------------------------
- Installing
------------------------------------------------------------

The supplied executable require MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR)
version v80 (R2012b). You can download and install the appropriate MCR for
your operating system through these links (64-bit architecture computers ONLY):

Linux:   http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/bin/MCR_R2012b_glnxa64_installer.zip
Windows: http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/bin/MCR_R2012b_win64_installer.exe
MacOS:	 http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/bin/MCR_R2012b_maci64_installer.zip

Note that the version of MCR is critical to the functionality (i.e. does not
work with other MCR versions).

This software was tested on
(i)  Windows 8 64-Bit with 6GB RAM
(ii) Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with 6GB RAM
(iii)Mac OS X 10.8 with 2GB RAM

- Running
------------------------------------------------------------

To reproduce the results in the SIGGRAPH 2012 paper:
----------------------------------------------------

[Note that baby.mp4 and wrist.mp4 results, which used iir temporal filters are
not reproduced, as this binary executable does not support iir filters]

1. Download the source videos from the project web page into a directory
"data" inside the directory containing this executable.
2. Depending on your OS:

Windows: run reproduce_results.bat

Linux: run ./reproduce_results.sh
    [if Matlab Compiler Runtime is installed in a directory other than 
    '/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v80', the default path on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,
    run following in command line before running reproduce_results.sh: 
    MCR='path/to/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v80'
    export MCR] 

MacOS: run ./reproduce_results.sh
    [if Matlab Compiler Runtime is installed in a directory other than 
    '/Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v80', the default path on Mac OS X 10.8,
    run following in command line before running reproduce_results.sh: 
    MCR='path/to/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v80'
    export MCR] 

NOTE MacOS Users: Strings of "This process is attempting to exclude an item from
Time MAchine by path without administrator privileges. This is not supported" appear.
They do not, however, affect the generated results. This applies also to processing
your own videos.
    
3. The results will be saved under the directory ResultsSIGGRAPH2012

NOTE: Generating each of the results will take a few minutes. We
have selected parameters that result in better looking videos,
however, depending on your application, you may not need such high
quality results.

The parameters we used to generate the results presented in the
paper can be found in the script "reproduceResults.m". Please refer to the
paper for more detail on selecting the values for the parameters. In some
cases, the parameters reported in the paper do not exactly match the ones
in the script, as we have refined our parameters through experimentation.
Feel free to experiment on your own!


To process your own videos:
---------------------------

Run the appropriate evm binary file (denote EVM_BIN):

Windows: evm.exe
Linux: ./run_evm.sh
MacOS: ./run_evm.sh

EVM_BIN vidFile outDir samplingRate magType lo hi alpha filterType [magnification_parameters]

vidFile: the input video file
outDir: directory under which the output video will be stored (the actual 
    name of the output video file is set automatically according to the
    choice of filter, amplification, etc.)
samplingRate: the sampling frequency of video [Hz] (notice this may be different
    from the frame rate of the actual video file)
magType: type of magnification (without quotes):
    "color": for amplifying color
    "motion": for amplifying motion
lo: low frequency cutoff [Hz]
hi: high frequency cutoff [Hz]
alpha: amplification factor
filterType: the type of temporal filter (without quotes)
    "ideal" [default]
    "butter"


------------------------------------------------------------
- Magnification Parameters
------------------------------------------------------------

This Section explains the parameters used by each type of magnification.
Note that these parameters are optional, and thus need not be specified (default values
are listed below).

But if specified, parameters should appear in this order in command-line:
      
chromAttenuation magParam

chromAttenuation: chrominance Attenuation
  (i) motion amplification default value: 0.1
  (ii) color amplification default value: 1
magParam: 
  (i) motion amplification default value: 16
  (ii) color amplification default value: 4

In Motion Amplification, magParam denotes the spatial frequency cutoff.
In Color Amplification, magParam denotes the level of spatial Gaussian Blur Stack.

- Fixes for Common Errors
------------------------------------------------------------
Error Message: 
      Could not find version 8.0 of the MCR.
      Attempting to load mclmcrrt8_0.dll
      Please install the correct version of the MCR.

Fix:
(I) If you are calling EVM_BIN from command line:
    Windows:
    $>> set PATH=C:\Program Files\MATLAB\MATLAB Compiler Runtime\v80\runtime\win64;%PATH%
    $>> export PATH
    $>> evm.exe vidFile outDir samplingRate magType lo hi alpha filterType [magnification_parameters]

    Linux/Mac:
    $>>  MCR=<root/directory/to/mcr>/v80
    $>>	 ./run_evm.sh $MCR vidFile outDir samplingRate magType lo hi alpha filterType [magnification_parameters]

(II) If you are calling EVM_BIN from script:
     Windows (.bat batch scripts)
     Include the following line somewhere in the beginning with a text editor:
     set PATH=C:\Program Files\MATLAB\MATLAB Compiler Runtime\v80\runtime\win64;%PATH%

     Linux/Mac (.sh Bourne Shell Scripts)
     Include the following line somewhere in the beginning with a text editor:
     MCR=<root/directory/to/mcr>/v80

     Call EVM_BIN with the following syntax:
     ./run_evm.sh $MCR vidFile outDir samplingRate magType lo hi alpha filterType [magnification_parameters]
